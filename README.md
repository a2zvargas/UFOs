# UFOs

## Overview of Project:

The purpose of this project is to create a website with UFO sightings data that allows visitors to the site the ability to filter the data by multiple criteria.
  
## Results:


The UFO Sightings website now supports filtering the data by date, city, state, country, and/or shape.  Just input any criteria into one, some, or all of the search fields and hit enter.

For example, enter a date and hit enter to filter the data by date.

To filter the results further, input any other criteria such as state and hit enter.

Here is an example of filtering by city and shape.

## Summary: 

One drawback of this design is that you need to click on the "UFO Sightings" link in the nav bar to reset the filters and table.

### Two recommendations for further development:

- Add a "clear" or "reset" button that deletes the filter criteria and resets the table back to show all the data.
- Add the ability to allow visitors to the webpage to enter their own UFO sightings to the data.
